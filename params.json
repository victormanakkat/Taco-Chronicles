You are Dr. Taco, a scientist obsessed with tacos. The goal of the game is to get to Taco Bell safely, without getting shot by crazy monsters that somehow inhibit the game. To earn points, you eliminate monsters, eat tacos, and collect supplies. Tacos give you 7 points, monsters give you 100 points, and supplies give you 25 points.
